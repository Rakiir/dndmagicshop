**FUNCTIONALITY DETAILS:**  
+ You can specify the level of the spell on the items using the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.  
+ The 'Open Shop' button in the top right refreshes all items in the store, as well as generate new Shop Owner lines.  
+ The 'Re-Shuffle' button by each item replaces that single item if you don't like it.  
    - If you change the range of the spell level, it will effect only that one item you are reshuffling, other items outside of the new spell level range will not be effected.
