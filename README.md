# dndmagicshop

_A Web App written using Angular._
**This DM tool is for the D&D 5e.**  
Generates 10 random magic items with one of _**361 different spells**_ to be sold in a shop to your players.  
Clicking on the name of a magic item will **link you to the spell's official page on DnDBeyond.com!**  
  
**FUNCTIONALITY:**  
+ You can specify the level of the spell on the items using the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.  
+ The 'Open Shop' button in the top right refreshes all items in the store, as well as generate new Shop Owner lines.  
+ The 'Re-Shuffle' button by each item replaces that single item if you don't like it.  
    - If you change the range of the spell level, it will effect only that one item you are reshuffling, other items outside of the new spell level range will not be effected.  
+ The 'Roll Initiative' brings up a new tab with the stat block of either a Mage, Acolyte, Knight, Guard, or Commoner -- should your players decide to attack the shop owner or they steal from him and the shop owner decides to fight back.
